# Technical Requirements Document: Cursor IDE - Social Network for Motorhome Owners & Digital Nomads

**Date:** March 29, 2025
**Version:** 1.1
**Status:** Draft
**Author:** Gemini AI

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the technical requirements for the Cursor IDE platform, detailing the technologies, architecture, and infrastructure considerations for the development team.

## 2. Technology Stack

* **Frontend:**
    * Framework: React (JavaScript library for building user interfaces)
    * UI Library: Shadcn UI (for building reusable UI components with Tailwind CSS)
    * State Management: React Context API (for initial MVP, may evolve to Zustand or Recoil for more complex state management)
    * Styling: Tailwind CSS (utility-first CSS framework)
* **Backend:**
    * Framework: Django (Python web framework)
    * Language: Python
    * Database: PostgreSQL (Relational database for structured data)
    * API Development: Django REST Framework (for building RESTful APIs)
* **Mapping & Location:**
    * Google Maps Platform (JavaScript API for map display, Directions API for route planning, Places API for place search and details)
* **Payments:**
    * Stripe (for handling subscription payments and billing)
* **Storage:**
    * Cloudflare R2 (for storing user-uploaded media files: profile pictures, post images/videos, place photos)
* **Authentication:**
    * Django's built-in authentication system for email/password login.
    * Integration with Google Sign-In via appropriate Django libraries (e.g., `django-allauth`).
* **Notifications:**
    * (To be decided - potentially Django Channels for real-time notifications or a third-party notification service)
* **Caching:**
    * Redis (for caching frequently accessed data to improve performance)
* **Task Queue:**
    * Celery (for handling asynchronous tasks, such as sending emails or processing large uploads)
* **Deployment:**
    * (To be decided - potentially a cloud platform like AWS, Google Cloud Platform, or DigitalOcean, configured for Django and a React frontend)

## 3. Architecture

* **Frontend (React):** Will act as a Single Page Application (SPA) consuming APIs from the Django backend. It will handle user interface, user interactions, and rendering in the user's browser.
* **Backend (Django):** Will be responsible for:
    * Handling user authentication and authorization.
    * Managing data models and database interactions (PostgreSQL).
    * Implementing business logic and API endpoints using Django REST Framework.
    * Processing payments via Stripe.
    * Interacting with Google Maps APIs.
    * Managing file uploads and storage on Cloudflare R2.
    * Handling notifications and background tasks.
* **API Communication:** The frontend and backend will communicate using RESTful APIs over HTTPS.

## 4. Infrastructure Considerations

* **Database Server:** Provisioning and management of a PostgreSQL database instance.
* **Backend Server(s):** Deployment environment for the Django application (web servers, application servers).
* **Frontend Hosting:** Platform for hosting the static assets of the React application (e.g., Netlify, Vercel, AWS S3 with CloudFront, or similar).
* **Cloudflare R2 Configuration:** Setting up and managing buckets for media storage.
* **Stripe Integration:** Securely implementing Stripe API keys and webhooks.
* **Google Maps API Keys:** Obtaining and securing necessary API keys.
* **DNS Management:** Configuring DNS records for the platform domain.
* **SSL Certificates:** Implementing HTTPS for secure communication.
* **Monitoring and Logging:** Setting up tools for monitoring application performance, server health, and error logging.
* **Scalability:** The infrastructure should be designed to allow for horizontal scaling of backend and frontend components as the user base grows.

## 5. Security Requirements

* **Data Encryption:** Sensitive data (passwords, payment information) must be encrypted at rest and in transit.
* **Authentication and Authorization:** Securely authenticate users and authorize access to resources based on their roles and permissions.
* **Protection Against Common Web Vulnerabilities:** Implement measures to prevent CSRF, XSS, SQL injection, and other common web security threats.
* **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct periodic security assessments and penetration testing.
* **Secure API Design:** Follow security best practices when designing and implementing APIs.
* **Compliance:** Adhere to relevant data privacy regulations.

## 6. Performance Requirements

* **Page Load Times:** Ensure fast loading times for all pages and resources.
* **API Response Times:** APIs should respond quickly to user requests.
* **Scalability:** The platform should be able to handle a growing number of users and data without significant performance degradation.
* **Optimize Database Queries:** Write efficient database queries to ensure optimal performance.
* **Utilize Caching:** Implement caching mechanisms to reduce database load and improve response times.

## 7. Deployment Process

* Establish a clear and repeatable deployment process.
* Utilize version control (e.g., Git) for code management.
* Implement CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) pipelines for automated building, testing, and deployment of both the frontend and backend.
* Have rollback strategies in place in case of deployment failures.

These documents should now accurately reflect the technology stack with React for the frontend. Let me know if there are any other adjustments needed!
